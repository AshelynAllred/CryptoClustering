# CryptoClustering
Unsupervised Machine Learning as part of a Data Analytics course

## Where to find everything
Data used for this project is available in the `Resources/` directory. All of the actual code is in the `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` in the project root folder.

## Citations/Credit
I referenced GitHub user [@emilymees' project](https://github.com/emilymees/Module19Homework/tree/main) primarily for a refresher on pandas preferred syntax and various other function calls, as well as to make sure I was on the right track.

Other than those pointers I referenced, everything within, including the list/dict comprehensions made within, is my own work built upon the mostly pre-structured template of cells and comments provided to students.

Cryptocurrency data was provided by edX/2U as part of their Data Analytics program.
